# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Text-without-NLTK
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a body of text. It involves classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral. This analysis can be applied to various forms of text, such as reviews, social media posts, or customer feedback, to understand public opinion or consumer sentiments. 

Without using the `nltk` library, sentiment analysis can be performed using libraries like `TextBlob` and `VaderSentiment` but we followed a muanual approach on this, which offer built-in functions to analyze text and assign sentiment scores based on linguistic patterns and lexical features. These tools provide polarity and subjectivity metrics, indicating the overall sentiment and the degree of personal bias or opinion in the text, respectively. 

By using sentiment analysis, businesses and organizations can gain insights into customer attitudes, monitor brand perception, and make data-driven decisions to improve products and services.
